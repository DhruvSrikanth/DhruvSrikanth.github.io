        <h4>What is this and Why am I doing it?</h4>
        <p>
            I'm not sure why I am doing this. 
            I think writing my thoughts and ideas about <em>Deep Learning</em> will help me better understand them as well as force me articulate them. 
            My hope is that this will help me refine these ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
            What this is however, is a journal detailing my thoughts and ideas on <em>Deep Learning</em>. The entries are binned based the topic/subtopic that they fall under. The content page represents a dynamic tree of my thoughts through time.
