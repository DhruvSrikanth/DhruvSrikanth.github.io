        <h2>Dhruv Srikanth</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Founding Researcher at <a href="https://www.weco.ai">Weco AI</a> where I work on building AI agents for research engineers and scientists (such as <a href="https://github.com/wecoai/aideml">aideml</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            Prior to this, I was a researcher at the <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/">Robotics Institute</a> at CMU advised by <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/artur-w-dubrawski/"> Artur Dubrawski</a>, 
            working on large multimodal models, robotics and time-series for healthcare (such as <a href="https://autonlab.org/AutonFeat/">AutonFeat</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06817">BIFURC</a>).
            Prior to this, I was a grad student at the UChicago, doing research on fairness alignment for deep learning models (such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11819">ASAC Guided Curriculum Learning</a>) at <a href="https://www.ttic.edu/">TTIC</a> with <a href="https://home.ttic.edu/~mturk/">Matthew Turk</a> 
            and <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/center-for-applied-artificial-intelligence">UChicago Booth</a> with <a href="https://sendhil.org/">Sendhil Mullainathan</a>.  
        </p>

        <h4>Research Interests</h4>
        <p>
            I continue to do independent research with past and present collaborators at TTIC, Stanford, CMU and others. 
            My research interests are focussed around learning fair and useful representation efficiently in the absence of supervision.
            I even briefly dabbled (barely) in Learning Theory (such as <a href="https://github.com/DhruvSrikanth/Boosting-Theory/blob/master/TTIC_Machine_Learning_Course_Project_Dhruv_Srikanth.pdf">"Boosting and Boostability"</a>).
            More on my current research can be found in my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Dvh53xkAAAAJ&hl=en">publications</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>Fun</h4>
        I enjoy building high-performance implementations of my research (such as <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9707193">2D-3D Single-View Reconstruction</a> and more <a href="pages/open_source.html">open source</a> projects).
        I spent time developing <a href="https://github.com/DhruvSrikanth/GoLLUM">GoLLUM</a>; a compiler for GoLite, a simple mix between Go and C/C++. The compiler uses <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> for its IR representation and is designed for an <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102374/latest/">ARM 64 bit</a> backend architecture.
