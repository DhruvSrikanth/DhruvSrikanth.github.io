				<h2>Dhruv Srikanth</h2>
				<p>I am a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago. I spend most of my time on Deep Learning and High-Performance Computing problems. Before joining the Master's program here at UChicago, I was at PES University where I studied Electronics and Communication Engineering specializing in Signals and Systems. The IEEE published a part of my undergraduate thesis on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9707193">2D-3D Single-View Reconstruction</a>.</p>

				<p> 
					I've spent some time as an <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/center-for-applied-artificial-intelligence/about">RA and Researcher</a> at the <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/center-for-applied-artificial-intelligence">UChicago Booth Center for Applied Artificial Intelligence</a>. 
					My research was on uncovering inductive biases and their causes and effects in popular deep learning models such as <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf">AlexNet</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385">ResNet</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993">DenseNet</a>.
				</p>

				<h4>Research Interests</h4>

				<p> <b>[Long-Term]</b> - I am most interested in the science of learning; how neural activities are <em>computed</em>, <em>cached</em> and <em>propogated</em> through the brain effciently.
					Toward understanding this, my work explores Deep Learning and High-Performance Computing problems. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>[Shorter Time Horizon]</b> - More specifically, generative frameworks (GAN, VAE, DDMP), energy-based models (EBMs) and self-supervised learning (SSL). 
					Toward developing visual learning tools for Generative Adversarial Networks, I developed several GAN experimentation <a href="https://github.com/stars/DhruvSrikanth/lists/ganz">packages</a>. 
					More on my current work can be found in my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Dvh53xkAAAAJ&hl=en">publications</a> and <a href="pages/open_source.html"> open source projects</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					My passion for HPC primarily resides in accelerating simulation through distributed-memory parallelism and GPU programming.
				</p>

				<h4>Broader Interests</h4>
				<p>
					Though I am most interested in the science of learning, I often take an engineering approach to understanding it. This has led me to develop several open source tools and libraries that can be found <a href="pages/open_source.html">here</a>. The interdiscplinary nature of Deep Learning has kept me reading; Reinforcement Learning, Game Theory, Compuational Learning Theory and Neuroscience have been fascinating to learn about. Here's my brief foray into Learning Theory; An analysis of <a href="https://github.com/DhruvSrikanth/Boosting-Theory/blob/master/TTIC_Machine_Learning_Course_Project_Dhruv_Srikanth.pdf">"<em>Boosting and Boostability</em>"</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					What excites me about Deep Learning is its infancy and novelty. What drives me is its potential to impact and an unquenched curiosity.
				</p>
				<h4>Fun</h4>
				In order to better understand the software engineering aspect of Deep Learning, I developed the following frameworks inspired by <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html">PyTorch</a>:
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://github.com/DhruvSrikanth/pynn">PyNN</a> - A Deep Learning library for Python using purely <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/">NumPy</a>.</li>
					<li><a href="https://github.com/DhruvSrikanth/CUDANN">CUDANN</a> - A Deep Learning library for C++ accelerated by <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/">CUDA</a> on NVIDIA GPUs.
				</ul>
