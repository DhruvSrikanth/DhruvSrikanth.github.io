				<h2>Dhruv Srikanth</h2>
				<p>
					TLDR; I am a researcher advised by <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/artur-w-dubrawski/"> Artur Dubrawski</a> at the <a href="https://autonlab.org/">Auton Lab</a> in the <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/">Robotics Institute</a> at Carnegie Mellon University, 
					where I created and lead <a href="https://github.com/autonlab/AutonFeat/tree/main">AutonFeat</a>; an automatic featurization library for lightning fast feature extraction and selection.  
					My research is focussed around learning fair and useful representations in the absence of supervision; unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, weakly-supervised, representation and meta learning.
					I apply my work to computer vision for robotics and time-series around the healthcare domain and enjoy building high-performance implementations of my work.
				<p>
					As CS graduate student at the <a href="https://cs.uchicago.edu/">University of Chicago</a>, I spent time as an <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/center-for-applied-artificial-intelligence/about">RA and Researcher</a> 
					at the <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/center-for-applied-artificial-intelligence">UChicago Booth Center for Applied Artificial Intelligence</a> advised by <a href="https://sendhil.org/">Sendhil Mullainathan</a>. 
					My research was on uncovering and proving the presence of inductive biases, their causes and effects in popular deep learning models such as <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf">AlexNet</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385">ResNet</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993">DenseNet</a>. 
					I also spent time at the <a href="https://www.ttic.edu/">Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago</a> (TTIC) working on fairness and adversarial robustness in deep learning models advised by <a href="https://home.ttic.edu/~mturk/">Matthew Turk</a>.
					Before grad school, I studied Electronics and Communication Engineering specializing in Signals and Systems. The IEEE published a part of my undergraduate thesis on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9707193">2D-3D Single-View Reconstruction</a>.</p>

				<h4>Research Interests</h4>

				<p> <b>[Long-Term]</b> - I am most interested in the science of learning; how neural activities are <em>computed</em>, <em>cached</em> and <em>propogated</em> through the brain effciently.
					Toward understanding this, my work explores Deep Learning and High-Performance Computing problems. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>[Shorter Time Horizon]</b> - More specifically, I am interested in generative networks (GAN, VAE, DDMP), representation learning (not RL but RL) and self-supervised learning (SSL). 
					I developed several GAN experimentation <a href="https://github.com/stars/DhruvSrikanth/lists/ganz">packages</a> as visual learning tools. 
					More on my current work can be found in my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Dvh53xkAAAAJ&hl=en">publications</a> and <a href="pages/open_source.html"> open source projects</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					My passion for HPC primarily resides in accelerating simulation through distributed-memory parallelism and GPU programming.
				</p>

				<h4>Broader Interests</h4>
				<p>
					Though I am most interested in the science of learning, I often take an engineering approach to understanding it. This has led me to develop several open source tools and libraries that can be found <a href="pages/open_source.html">here</a>. 
					The interdiscplinary nature of Deep Learning has kept me reading; Reinforcement Learning, Game Theory, Compuational Learning Theory and Neuroscience have been fascinating to learn about. 
					Here's my brief foray into Learning Theory; An analysis of <a href="https://github.com/DhruvSrikanth/Boosting-Theory/blob/master/TTIC_Machine_Learning_Course_Project_Dhruv_Srikanth.pdf">"<em>Boosting and Boostability</em>"</a>. 
					What excites me about Deep Learning is its infancy and novelty and a little fun with math.
				</p>

				<h4>Fun</h4>
				In order to better understand the software engineering aspect of Deep Learning, I developed the following frameworks inspired by <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html">PyTorch</a>:
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://github.com/DhruvSrikanth/pynn">PyNN</a> - A Deep Learning library for Python using purely <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/">NumPy</a>.</li>
					<li><a href="https://github.com/DhruvSrikanth/CUDANN">CUDANN</a> - A Deep Learning library for C++ accelerated by <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/">CUDA</a> on NVIDIA GPUs.
				</ul>
				Most recently, I've spent time developing <a href="https://github.com/DhruvSrikanth/GoLLUM">GoLLUM</a>; a compiler for GoLite, a simple mix between Go and C/C++. The compiler uses <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> for its IR representation and is designed for an <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102374/latest/">ARM 64 bit</a> backend architecture.
