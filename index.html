				<p>I am a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago. I spend most of my time on Deep Learning and High-Performance Computing problems. </p>

				<p> 
					I've spent some time as a <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/center-for-applied-artificial-intelligence/about">RA and Researcher</a> at the <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/center-for-applied-artificial-intelligence">UChicago Booth Center for Applied Artificial Intelligence</a>. 
					My research was on uncovering inductive biases and their causes and effects in popular deep learning models such as <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf">AlexNet</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385">ResNet</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993">DenseNet</a>.
				</p>

				<h5>Research Interests</h5>
				<p> I am most interested in the science of learning; how neural activities are <em>computed</em>, <em>cached</em> and <em>propogated</em> through the brain effciently.
					Toward understanding this, my work explores Deep Learning and High-Performance Computing problems. 
					More specifically, generative frameworks (GAN, VAE, DDMP), energy-based models (EBMs) and self-supervised learning (SSL). 
					Most of my work has been in the Computer Vision domain, however, I have dipped my toes in NLP and time-series (I wonder which classification has more papers on autoregressive models). Feel free to explore my <a href="pages/publications.html">publications</a> and <a href="pages/open_source.html"> open source</a> projects for more details.
				</p>

				<p>
					Though my interest in Deep Learning is out of curiosity, my work in HPC is out of necessity. I have always been excited about a computer's architecture and HPC enables me to explore the limits of computation on large scale problems. This has led me to develop several open source simulation <a href="pages/open_source.html">tools</a>. 
				</p>

				<h5>Broader Interests</h5>
				<p>
					Though I am most interested in the science of learning, I often take an engineering approach to understanding it. This has led me to develop several open source tools and libraries that can be found <a href="pages/open_source.html">here</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have thoroughly enjoyed exploring Reinforcement Learning, Game Theory, Computational Learning Theory, and Neuroscience, as a means of inspiration and curiosity. My brief foray into <a href="assets/boosting_and_boostability.pdf">Boosting and Boostability</a> drives me to create more probabilistic models for efficient learning i.e. "focus on the hard cases".
				</p>
				<p>
					What excites me about Deep Learning is its infancy and novelty. What drives me is the potential to impact and an unquenched curiosity.
